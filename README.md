        <li><strong>User Story #1:</strong> My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main" , which contains all other elements.</li>
        <li><strong>User Story #2:</strong> I should see an element with a corresponding id="title" , which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").</li>
        <li><strong>User Story #3:</strong> I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div" .</li>
        <li><strong>User Story #4:</strong> Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image" .</li>
        <li><strong>User Story #5:</strong> Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.</li>
        <li> <strong>User Story #6:</strong> I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info" , which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.</li>
        <li> <strong>User Story #7:</strong> I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link" , which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank" ).</li>
        <li> <strong>User Story #8:</strong> The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.</li>
        <li> <strong>User Story #9:</strong> The img element should be centered within its parent element.</li>
